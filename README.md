Introduction to Python

* the introduction of using commands and how to navigate them

* apply how to use different variables within python, such int, floats and decimal numbers
* got familier with the use of output variable to produce the task performed, such as normally used variable print()
* the application of true or false value, which is another variable in python
* data structures to asign mutliple variables

* Completed some exercises to test myself how to narvigate with these different operators 
* got to learn about boolean values (True or False)

* with for loop i learnt that you can execute sets of statements 
* learnt about tuples how they are differentiated from sets and lists using different brackets, for tuples we use curly brackets ()
* also learnt how lists are constructed using square brackets [ ]
