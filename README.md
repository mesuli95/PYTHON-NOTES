# Python-week-1

Introduction to Python 

* python can be used on a server to create web applications.
* python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
* python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
* python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
* python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
* the introduction of using commands and how to navigate them
* learnt how to apply the syntax of python
  
Variables and Operators, data structure
  
* apply how to use different variables within python, such int, floats and decimal numbers
* got familier with the use of output variable to produce the task performed, such as normally used variable print()
* the application of true or false value, which is another variable in python
* data structures to asign mutliple variables
* the use of arithmetic operation to perform calculations
* the operators on strings, the use of operator to add two strings
* Completed some exercises to test myself how to narvigate with these different operators 
* got to learn about boolean values (True or False)

Lists, Sets, Dictionaries and Tuples
  
* learnt how lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable using square brackets [ ]
* A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed. they using 
* also got to do some exercises to test myself how to list items in a variable
* learnt about dictionaries on how they are constructed and applied using curly { }, and they have keys and values
* learnt about tuples how they are differentiated from sets and lists using different brackets, for tuples we use curly brackets ()

Methods that are used in python

* learnt how to use different methods such as
* remove() to remove from the list
* pop() to remove the specified index 
* del also remove specified index
* clear() emptied the list
* 
Control flow (if , elif and else statements)

* got to learn how if statements are constructed to check the condition
* got to learn of "elif" keyword which is used if previous conditions were not true
* also got to learn how "else" keyword function to catches anything that is catched by preeciding conditions
* accessing tuple by using indexing format

Loops 

* learnt how loops are used in python to execute statements
* With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true
* with for loop i learnt that you can execute sets of statements
* With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next
* With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true
* the importance of using inreament while looping to avoid the loop continuing forever

Factorials

* learnt that the factorial represented by a exclamation mark after a number
* also that is equal to the product of that number, all the integers below it to one
* also learnt that is important to check the input
* factorial can be used to check the variable type

Functions 

* in python a function is defined using "def" keyword
* example: def my_function() 
* to call a function, use the functiopn name followed by parentheses
* The function body is indented and contains the code that performs the desired operation on the inputs, and the "return" keyword is used to specify the output
* a function may mutate a variable without returning anything
* Functions can take one or more arguments, and they may or may not return a value
* the special Python keyword "None" represents the absence of value, and it is the default return value for functions that do not explicitly return anything

Classes and Objects

* When we define a class, we use an uppercase letter for the class name, and we start defining all the functions and attributes inside the class definition
* We usually begin by creating a special function called the initialization function, or "init" function, which gets called every time an instance of the class is created
*
