Introduction to Data Analytics

* Analytics is at the heart of modern business. Virtually every organization collects large quantities of data about its customers, products, employees, and service offerings.
* Managers naturally seek to analyze that data and harness the information it contains to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and profitability of their work.
* The ultimate role of a data analyst is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making processes within an organization. 
* This involves several key responsibilities and skills.

Data Collection and Preparation:

* Sourcing data from various channels, including databases, spreadsheets, and external sources,
* Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

Data Analysis:

* Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or other analytic tools to interpret data,
* Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations that might not be immediately obvious.

Data Visualization and Storytelling:

* Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,
* Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of the data to stakeholders.

Decision Support:

* Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions,
* Providing context around the data, including potential implications and future trends.

Collaboration and Communication:

* Working closely with other departments, such as marketing, finance, and operations, to understand their data needs and provide insights,
* Effectively communicating complex data findings in a clear and concise manner to non-technical stakeholders,
Continuous Learning and Adaptation:

Continuous Learning and Adaptation

* Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies in data analysis.
* Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.

Analytics is made possible by:

* modern data, storage, and computing capabilities.

Analytics techniques

* Descriptive analytics, which answers the question, “What happened?”
* Diagnostic analytics, which answers the question, “Why did this happen?”
* Predictive analytics, which answers the question, “What might happen in the future?”
* Prescriptive analytics, which answers the question, “What should we do next?”

Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning

* Machine learning (ML) - is a subset of AI techniques. ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge.
 Or, in other terms, ML techniques are AI techniques designed to learn.
* Artificial intelligence (AI) - includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior. 
 as the name implies, you are trying to ask computer systems to artificially behave as if they were intelligent. Now, of course, it is not possible for a modern computer to function at the level of complex reasoning found in the human mind, but you can try to mimic some small portions of human behavior and judgment.
* Deep learning - is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way. It is a highly specialized subfield of machine learning that is most commonly used for image, video, and sound analysis.

Data element

* A data element is an attribute about a person, place, or thing containing data within a range of values. Data elements also describe characteristics of activities, including orders, transactions, and events. 

Data type

* A data type limits the values a data element can have. 
* Tabular data is data organized into a table, made up of columns and rows. A table represents information about a single topic. Each column represents a uniquely named field within a table, also called a variable, about a single characteristic. The contents of each column contain values for the data element as defined by the column header

Structured data

* Structured data is tabular in nature and organized into rows and columns. Structured data is what typically comes to mind when looking at a spreadsheet. With clearly defined column headings, spreadsheets are easy to work with and understand. In a spreadsheet, cells are where columns and rows intersect.
